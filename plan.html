<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jacob Jackson<br>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The mission of this website is to reach out to a greater audience of people through the means of the internet. By having this larger audience of people, the company hopes for an increase in the number of weekly costume commissions and to have a larger gathering of people attending the company's monthly parties.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>One way to determine if the website has successfully achieved it's goal is to analyse the number of costume commission each month. If the number of costumes that have been created each week increases since the inception of the site, this is due to a surge of people discovering the website. Additionally, another way to figure out if the CossiePlay site has been successful is to look at the party numbers, and look at the census of people showing. If the average amount of people attending the party each month has increased since the creation of the site, and the average group of people showing up and attending the party are the younger generation, it is safe to say that the site has successful achieved it's goal.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the website will be millennials, particularly in the teenage and young adult range. Since younger people are the target audience, the site has to be designed in a way that could be considered hip and cool, and something that looks aesthetically pleasing.</p>
