<img id="WhatPic" src="images/book-fair-678264_1280.jpg" height="416px" width="639px">
<p>Cosplay, formed from the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories which represent a specific character. These cosplayers take influence from many sources, including but not limited to anime, comic books, cartoons, video games, movies and television.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of cosplaying as a hobby since 1990 has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay is a relevant topic over social networks, websites and other forms of media, causing cosplay events to become common features of fan conventions, and even within dedicated conventions and local/international competitions.</p>
